An all-in-one tool for The Battle Cats that allows Users to sort, read, and modify files that they import into it.

## In Development
Battle Cats Complete is still far from its fully functional state. This app is a hobby and passion project. Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SNSE8HNhmP) if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you found any bugs!

## Usage
To use this app, you must provide game files for it to read. These files are not included in the app or repository; they must be obtained through your own personal and legal means.
