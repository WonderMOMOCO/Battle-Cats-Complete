[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20Community-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/SNSE8HNhmP)

An all-in-one tool for The Battle Cats that allows Users to sort, read, and modify files that are imported into it.

## In Development
Battle Cats Complete is still far from its fully functional state. This app is a hobby and passion project. Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SNSE8HNhmP) if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you found any bugs! This is also where you can find the Roadmap!

## Usage
To use this app, you must provide game files for it to read. These files are not included in the app or repository; they must be obtained through your own personal and legal means.

Heres what the app is currently capable of:
- Importing Game Data
  - Import from emulator
  - Import from pack/apk
  - Import from archives
- Displaying Cat Data
  - Forms
  - Stats
  - Abilities
  - Talents
  - Descriptions
  - Evolution Info

### Setup
Because this app is an open-source hobby project and not signed with a paid certificate, your OS may flag it on the first run.

> 🛡️ **Windows Users:**
> You may see a blue popup saying **"Windows protected your PC"** (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen).
>
> To start the app, click **More info**, then click **Run anyway**.

> 🍎 **MacOS Users:**
> You may see an error saying **"App is damaged and can't be opened"** or **"Unidentified Developer"** (Gatekeeper).
>
> To fix this, type the following command in Terminal: `xattr -cr`, then drag the app file into the terminal window to auto-fill the path.

## Credit
Various people have motivated and helped me create this project:
- **TheWWRNerdGuy:** Provided a repo which holds Rust code for reading raw game data, also gave coding tips.
- **fieryhenry:** Coder with many Battle Cats related projects of their own, of which I took inspiration from.
- **Timtams:** Did field research to confirm certain game data quirks, also supplied some custom assets.
- **SweetDonut0:** Used their Cat Stats Tool web-app hosted on the Wiki as a reference for level scaling code.
