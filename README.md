An all-in-one tool for The Battle Cats that allows Users to sort, read, and modify files that they import into it.

## In Development
Battle Cats Complete is still far from its fully functional state. This app is a hobby and passion project. Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SNSE8HNhmP) if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you found any bugs! This is also where you can find the Roadmap!

## Usage
To use this app, you must provide game files for it to read. These files are not included in the app or repository; they must be obtained through your own personal and legal means.

Heres what the app is currently capable of:
- Sorting user-imported files for proper display/use
  - Import ZIP Archives
  - Import Folders
  - Import Game.zip
- Displaying Cat Data
  - Forms
  - Stats
  - Abilities
  - Talents
  - Descriptions
  - Evolution Info
- Easy exporting allowing for efficient sharing
  - Only exports app-essential files
  - Exports to game.zip archive

Various people have motivated and helped me create this project:

- **TheWWRNerdGuy:** Provided a repo which holds Rust code for reading raw game data, also gave coding tips.
- **SweetDonut0:** Used their Cat Stats Tool web-app hosted on the Wiki as a reference for level scaling code.
