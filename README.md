An all-in-one tool for The Battle Cats that allows Users to sort, read, and modify files that they import into it.

## In Development
Battle Cats Complete is still far from its fully functional state. This app is a hobby and passion project. Here are the features it has and the features I plan to add:

### Features
* Reading Cat data

### Plans
* Reading Cat talents
* Reading Enemy data
* Reading Stage data
* Reading Animation data
* Effective Cat & Enemy stats/uptime
* Easy Game modding

## Usage
To use this app, you must provide game files for it to read. These files are not included in the app or repository; they must be obtained through your own personal and legal means.
